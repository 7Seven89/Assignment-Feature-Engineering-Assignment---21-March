    "### Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding** is used for categorical variables that have a clear order or ranking. It assigns integer values to categories based on their rank. For example, for a variable \"Size\" with values \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" we might encode them as Small = 1, Medium = 2, Large = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding**, on the other hand, is used for categorical variables without any inherent order. It simply assigns a unique integer to each category. For instance, for a variable \"Color\" with values \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" we could encode them as Red = 0, Green = 1, Blue = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose **Ordinal Encoding** when the categories have a logical order (like Size), whereas **Label Encoding** would be appropriate for unordered categories (like Color)."

    "### Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** assigns integer values to categories based on the relationship with the target variable. The categories are ordered by the mean of the target variable for each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a feature \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD,\" and our target variable is income, we would calculate the average income for each education level. The encoding would reflect this order, assigning higher values to education levels associated with higher average incomes. \n",
